<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Peripheral Nerve Repair Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Nerve Conduit</li><li>Nerve Wrap and Cap</li><li>Nerve Graft</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The peripheral nerve repair market comprises three key types: nerve conduits, nerve wraps and caps, and nerve grafts. Nerve conduits are tubular structures that guide regenerating nerves across gaps, promoting healing. Nerve wraps and caps provide protective barriers around damaged nerves, enhancing regeneration. Nerve grafts involve transplanting healthy nerve tissue to repair severed nerves, offering a direct connection for regrowth. Each type plays a critical role in improving outcomes for patients with peripheral nerve injuries.</p></p>
