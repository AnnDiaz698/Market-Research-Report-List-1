<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Drone Surveillance Radar Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PSR(Primary Surveillance Radar)</li><li>SSR(Secondary Surveillance Radar)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The drone surveillance radar market consists of two primary types: Primary Surveillance Radar (PSR) and Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR). PSR detects objects by sending out radio waves and analyzing the reflected signals, making it effective for tracking large targets at various ranges. In contrast, SSR relies on transponders onboard the aircraft, which respond to radar signals, providing more detailed information about the target, such as identity and altitude. Both systems play crucial roles in enhancing airspace security and monitoring.</p></p>
